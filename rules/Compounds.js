// # All words must contain at least one hyphen, even if the

// # "?" at the end of the line will turn off the suggestion that
// # uses a hyphen and offers lower-cased joined suggestions.
// # "$" at the end of the line will allow the hyphenated and non-
// # hyphenated variants, but will suggest a lower-cased non-hyphenated
// # variant
